# Thesis Project – Using Generative AI to Filter Noise in the Virgo Interferometer

This repository contains the written thesis and the presentation I used to illustrate my work to the evaluation commission. The project explores the use of Generative AI techniques to distinguish instrumental noise from real gravitational wave signals in data from the Virgo interferometer.

⚠️ Unfortunately, I am not able to publish the Python code developed for this project due to usage restrictions.
